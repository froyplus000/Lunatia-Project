[Setup]
You awaken, disoriented, in a place unknown.
Around you, trees sway, rocks sit, and grass rustles.
This forest feels unfamiliar... what will you do now?
[Lunatia City Front Gate]
A huge gate looms before a vast city.
Yet, no signs of life stir behind its walls.
[Lunatia City Entrance]
You've entered Lunatia’s grand city.
But why is there no one here? The silence is unsettling.
[Lunatia City Centre]
You stand at the heart of the city.
A great hole lies ominously beneath your feet.
What must you do here? The quiet grows heavier.
<Sign> "Only those who give their passage at the city's heart will unveil its true form."
[Lunatia Forest Upper]
You've climbed to the upper reaches of Lunatia Forest.
A strange object lies ahead. Is it worth investigating?
[Lunatia Forest Lower]
A cryptic note rests on the ground below.
What could it reveal to you?
[Obtained License]
You’ve found a Lunatia City Entrance License.
Is this your key to entering the city?
[Obtained Clear Potion]
A Clear Potion now rests in your hands.
What mysteries does it hold?
[Luminara City of Light]
At last, you’ve uncovered the real city.
Welcome to Luminara, the City of Light.
Congratulations on completing your first journey.
You may now rest, traveler, until next time.
